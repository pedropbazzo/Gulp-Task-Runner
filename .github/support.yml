  Issues are reserved for bugs and features. Here are a few places to find answers to your question:

  * For community support, use the `gulp` tag on [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/gulp).

  * Participate in community chat on [Gitter](https://gitter.im/gulpjs/gulp).

  * To get paid support directly from the maintainers, sign up for [Tidelift](https://tidelift.com/subscription/pkg/npm-gulp?utm_source=npm-gulp&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=support). Subscribers should email support@tidelift.com, mention that it's a question for Gulp, and describe your question. Straightforward questions are answered as part of your subscription. Additional consulting hours are available for more complex help.
